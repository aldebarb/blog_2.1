# blog_2.1
Newest version of my blog website.

This website allows guests to read all posts or they can register and login with their email addresses. Registered users can create, read, update and delete blog posts.

The file layout of this version follows the MVC pattern.

Using Object Oriented Programming for cleaner less repeatable code.

The singleton design is used in the connectdb class to only connect to the database once.
